[camera_calibration.m]
        The main file for estimating calibration matrix and parameters calculation.
[collect_image_points.m]
        Collect and measure image points on pattern image and save into file.
[world_coordinates_generator.m]
        Generate 96 world coordinates of points on the two checkerboards, which is later used for image coordinates reconstruction.
[root_mean_squared_error.m]
        Calculate root-mean-squared error between measured and reconstructed image coordinates from files.
[plot_points.m]
        A function to plot the measured and reconstructed image coordinates, which is called in camera_calibration.m.

[image_coordinates_12.txt] and [world_coordinates_12.txt] are the 12 measured image and world coordinates used for camera calibration.
[world_coordinates_96.txt] is the 96 measured world coordinates generated by world_coordinates_generator.m.
[measured_image_coordinates_96.txt] contains 96 measured image points
[reconstructed_image_coordinates_96.txt] contains the reconstructed image points using the 96 world coordinates and the calibration matrix M.
