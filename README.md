## Assignment 1 - Camera Calibartion
Calibrate a digital camera with two orthogonal checkerboard patterns and find the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters so as to be able to capture images of objects from known locations and with a known camera model.

## Assignment 2 - 3D Reconstruction from Disparity
Explore the epipolar geometry and the ability to recover depth and obtain 3D coordinates from a stereo pair of images.

## Assignment 3 - [Photometric Stereo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xuzebin/CS6643-ComputerVision/master/Assignment3/README.md)
Implement the shape from shading algorithm that reconstructs a surface using the concept of photometric stereo.
