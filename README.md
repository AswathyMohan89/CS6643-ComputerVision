# CS6643-ComputerVision
CS-GY 6643 Computer Vision course

### Assignment 1 - Camera Calibartion
Calibrate a digital camera with two orthogonal checkerboard patterns and find the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters so as to be able to capture images of objects from known locations and with a known camera model.

### Assignment 2 - 3D Reconstruction from Disparity
Explore the epipolar geometry and the ability to recover depth and obtain 3D coordinates from a stereo pair of images.
